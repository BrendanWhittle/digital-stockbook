  <p><b>Digital Stockbook</b></p>
  <p>The Stock Book is produced annually by the Marine Institute and provides up to date scientific information on the state of the fisheries resources exploited by the Irish fleet. It provides the latest scientific advice that informs fishing opportunities for the following year. The Stock Book has been published by the Marine Institute since 1993 and has evolved considerably over time. The Digital Stock Book app makes this advice available on-line in an interactive way â€“ for example it includes a forecasting tool that allows users to see the projected impact of different fishing scenarios.</p>
