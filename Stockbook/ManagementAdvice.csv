<ul><li> On 19 January 2015 the EU imposed a pelagic trawling ban until the end of April 2015. The ban aims to
protect vulnerable spawning aggregations. This applies to the Channel, Celtic Sea, Irish Sea and southern
North Sea.</li>
<li> On 25 March 2015 the EU set a catch limit of three fish per day per angler. Recreational fishing accounts
for 25% of sea bass catches</li>
<li> On 19 June 2015 the EU set catch limits for particular fishing gears in order to protect sea bass for the
remainder of 2015. The decision also comprises an area closure around Ireland for commercial fishing,
namely the Celtic Sea, Irish Sea, south of Ireland and west of Ireland (ICES areas 7.a-c,g,j,k outside the UK
12 mile zone), thereby extending a national measure, that Ireland has had in place for Irish vessels only, to
protect sea bass since 1990 to cover all EU vessels active in the area.</li>
<li> On 2 July 2015 the EU increased the minimum size for northern sea bass from 36 to 42 cm. The new rule
applies to both commercial and recreational fishermen. This aims to further improve protection and give
more chance for reproduction.</li>
<li> On 10 November 2015 the Commission proposed further measures. The proposals build upon and
strengthen the measures already put in place, with the aim of bringing the stock under MSY management
by 2017. They include:
<ul><li> a complete ban on fishing for the first half of 2016;</li>
<li> a 1-fish bag limit for recreational anglers and a monthly one tonne catch limit per commercial vessel
for the second half of 2016;</li>
<li> a continued area closure around Ireland for commercial fishing.</li></ul></li></ul></li>
<p>On 16 December the Member States adopted the following measures:
<li> In the first half of 2016: No fishing for sea bass by commercial vessels targeting sea bass, except for long lines,
pole and lines and set nets who will have a closure of two months in February and March 2016; a small by
catch allowance of 1% is envisaged for demersal trawlers and seiners per vessels per month to cover
unavoidable by by-catches. Recreational anglers may practise a catch and release fishery.</li>

10% of the area 7 quota to be fished in 8abde but Ireland generally does
not make use of this option.</li>
<li> More than half of the international landings from area 7 are taken in Irish
waters but the Irish TAC share is only 8%.</li>

depending on quota swaps to land their catches (see Figure 1 on the next page).</li>","<li> Fishing effort has shown a steady decrease since the 1990s.</li>
<li> Black and white anglerfish are partly caught in a targeted fishery: almost half of the Irish landings come from
trips where anglerfish was the dominant species. The remainder are taken in a more mixed fishery and are
mainly landed with megrim as well as various gadoids.</li>

If the recommended catch is lower than the 10 year average landings, plus 10% or F is higher than F<sub>MSY</sub>, then
the ''of which'' clause should be invoked. This is unlikely to address the STECF advice given in 2013 ''that to

reflecting that it is the least limiting stock for most fleets.</li>

for this stock are minor due to the relative low catches which are in the order of 30-50 t annually.</li>"

SWO-N,2015,"<li>The TAC for 2015 is 13,700 t. The EC has a large share of this TAC (8,347 t), but this is mainly split between Spain and Portugal.
