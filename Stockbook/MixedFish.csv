Summary,"<p> In 2016 ICES produced ecosystem overviews for four European ecoregions. These overviews provide a description of the ecosystems, identify the main human pressures, and explain how these pressures affect key ecosystem components. The Celtic Seas ecoregion overview, which covers the whole Irish EEZ including the West of Scotland, the Malin Shelf, the Irish Sea, and the Celtic Sea, is included in this section.  </p>  
<p> The five most important pressures in the Celtic Seas ecoregion are selective extraction of species, abrasion, smothering, substrate loss, and nutrient and organic enrichment. These pressures are linked mainly to the following human activities: fishing, aquaculture, coastal construction, land-based industry, maritime transport, agriculture, dredging, and offshore structures for renewable and non-renewable energy sources. </p>
<p> Figures more specific to Irish fisheries are included before the ICES overview. In general, relative fishing pressure has declined in the last ten years while relative spawning stock biomass has remained stable. 
In 2015/2016:
<li>  35% of stocks were fished below F<sub>MSY</sub>  (53% unknown) </li>
<li>  30% of stocks have SSB above B<sub>TRIGGER</sub>   (54% unknown) </li>
<li>  20% of landings came from stocks fished above F<sub>MSY</sub> </li>
<li>  96% of landings came from stocks having SSB above B<sub>TRIGGER</sub> </li> </p>
","<p> In 2016 ICES produced ecosystem overviews for four European ecoregions. Two more ecoregions were added in 2017 and the first four are due to be reviewed in 2018. These overviews provide a description of the ecosystems, identify the main human pressures, and explain how these pressures affect key ecosystem components. The interactive version of the Celtic Seas ecoregion overview, which covers the whole Irish EEZ including the West of Scotland, the Malin Shelf, the Irish Sea, and the Celtic Sea, is available at: <a href=""http://bit.ly/2y9mup3""  target=""_blank"">Click Here</a>. </p>

<p> In the near future ICES will publish a fisheries overview for the Celtic Seas ecoregion. This overview will summarise the state of all of the assessed fish and shellfish stocks and the fishing pressures being applied to them. It will do so in more detail than the ecosystem overview. The framework for the advice will be structured as: ecosystem overview -> fisheries overview -> single stock advice. Information and plots similar to the as-yet-unpublished ICES fisheries overviews are included in the current and MSFD D3 sections of the Stock Book 2017. </p>

Considerations,"FEAS advises that the following considerations should be taken into account when developing ecosystem based management objectives: 
<li>  Fishing has impacted a number of commercial species, with some commercial species such as cod and whiting in the Irish Sea now being considered collapsed. A cod long term management plan is currently in place. </li>
<li>  Demersal fisheries in the Celtic Sea, Irish Sea, West of Scotland and Rockall are mixed fisheries, catching a large number of commercial and non-commercial species.  Many of the species caught are discarded. Mixed fisheries do not only affect the commercial stocks that are presented in this Stock Book, but impact on the wider fish community. </li>
<li>  The ICES mixed fisheries advice for the Celtic Sea (7.b-c and 7.e-k) is included at the end of this section. However, ICES does not recommend specific mixed-fisheries catch opportunities as no mixed-fisheries management objectives are available. </li>
<li>  Discarding rates are also high on many commercial species in these areas.  Recently introduced technical measures such as increased cod-end mesh size and square mesh panels in the Celtic Sea need to be monitored in order to evaluate their effectiveness. Certain demersal quota species are now subject to the demersal landing obligation. </li>
<li>  Demersal trawling impacts on benthic habitats and their communities. The resilience and recoverability of habitats varies depending on substrate type, biota and type of fishing gear. The overall impact of demersal trawling on the seabed needs to be evaluated in relation to the proportion of different habitats impacted (see Fig. 5.1.4 in ICES Ecosystem Overview). </li>
<li>  A number of rare endangered and/or vulnerable species of cetaceans, seals, seabirds and elasmobranchs are resident or transient in Irish waters. The management of fisheries needs to ensure that the conservation of these species is not compromised.</li>
<li>  Pelagic fish species such as herring, blue whiting, mackerel and horse mackerel are keystone food web species and changes in their abundance can have significant consequences up the marine food chain.  </li>
<li>  Due to their low reproductive output and longevity, many deep-water fish species are very vulnerable to overfishing. High levels of exploitation have led to the depletion of many deep-water fish stocks in ICES subareas 6 and 7. </li>
<li>  NEAFC and the EU have already closed a number of areas on the Rockall Bank, the Hatton Bank, the Porcupine Bank and the western European Slope to bottom impacting fishing gear, where cold water corals are known to occur.  The UK is also in the process of establishing MPAs in a number of deep-water sites such as Rosemary Bank Seamount, Anton Dohrn, and The Canyons. Furthermore, the proposed EU deep-sea trawling ban, which could begin as early as January 2017, will restrict fishing below 800m with mobile bottom contacting gears. </li>
<li>  Deepwater species are dependent on nutrient input from the upper ocean layers via planktonic snow, mesopelagic species and fall of carcasses. This should be taken into account when considering the development of commercial fisheries for mesopelagic species. </li>
<li>  In order to implement the ecosystem approach to fisheries (EAFM), fisheries management should incentivise fishing behaviour and introduce management tools that reduce the impact of fishing on the wider ecosystem. </li>

PressureState,"<p> Relative fishing pressure (F/F<sub>MSY</sub>) and biomass (SSB/B<sub>TRIGGER</sub>) are shown for each of four Irish ecoregions (Irish Sea, Celtic Sea, West of Scotland, and Widely Distributed). Each plot on the top left shows SSB and F related against reference points (MSY where available, otherwise PA or qualitative). Stocks in the green region are exploited below F<sub>MSY</sub> and have an SSB that is above B<sub>TRIGGER</sub>. Stocks of unknown status are depicted in the top right plot. In both plots the size of each bubble corresponds to the landings of each stock in 2015. FU refers to <em>Nephrops</em> functional units. </p>
<p> The pie charts depict the proportion of the total 2015 landings in each region fished at or below F<sub>MSY</sub> (green), above F<sub>MSY</sub> (red) and of unknown status (grey) in relation to fishing mortality reference points (bottom left) and with biomass above B<sub>TRIGGER</sub> (green), below B<sub>TRIGGER</sub> (red) and of unknown status in relation to biomass reference points (bottom right). </p>
","<p> To assess progress towards GES the average ratio of F/F<sub>MSY</sub> and B/B<sub>MSY</sub> is plotted for demersal, pelagic and <em>Nephrops</em> stock seperately below (Figure 4).  These plots show that pelagic stocks have on average been fished below F<sub>MSY</sub> since the mid 2000s.  The <em>Nephrops</em> stocks have fluctuated around F<sub>MSY</sub> throughout the time series.  The largest change can be seen in demersal stocks where on average F was three times F<sub>MSY</sub> up to the mid 2000s and there has been a declining trend towards F<sub>MSY</sub> since then.  Average biomass for <em>Nephrops</em> and pelagic stocks has fluctuated above MSY B<sub>TRIGGER</sub> throught the time series.  The average biomass of demersal stocks shows an increasing trend since the mid 2000s and is now above MSY B<sub>TRIGGER</sub>.</p>
<p>The ratio of F in 2016 to F<sub>MSY</sub> and biomass in 2016 to MSY B<sub>TRIGGER</sub> for all the stocks with D3C1 and D3C2 assessments are plotted below (Figure 5).  The stock codes used by ICES are  shown to identify the individual stocks.   The stocks with green points are those with GES in 2017.  The stocks with red dots do not have GES. This plot shows that cod in the west of Scotland (cod.27.6a) is in the worst condition of all stocks with a very low biomass (close to zero) and an F that is several times F<sub>MSY</sub>.  Others stock in very poor condition include whiting in the Irish Sea (whg,27.7a) and plaice in 7.h-k (ple.27.7h-k).  The majority of other stocks without GES are either close to the targets or with biomasses above MSY B<sub>TRIGGER</sub>.  There are also a number of depleted stocks which now have low fishing mortality but their biomasses are yet to recover.  These are in the bottom left quadrant and include Irish Sea sole (sol.27.7a), herring west of Scotland (her.276a7bc) and whiting west of Scotland (whg-scow).</p>
<p>The bar plot (Figure 6) shows the catches or landings by stock sorted from highest volume to lowest volume.  The colour of the bar indicates whether the stock has GES status (green = yes, red = no, grey = unknown). Circles indicate landings, whereas triangles are catches. The two very high volume stocks, blue whiting (whb-comb) and mackerel (mac-nea), were both overfished in 2016.  These stocks account for a large proportion of the landed biomass in 2016.  Although overfished in relation to F<sub>MSY</sub> both stocks have biomasses above MSY B<sub>TRIGGER</sub>.  </p>"
D3Ass,,"<h3> MSFD PRELIMINARY GES RESULTS FOR D3 IN 2017 </h3> 
<p> For all stocks exploited by the Irish fleet of OSPAR Region III, 
<li>  Overall, 46% of stocks where an assessment is carried out achieve GES. These stocks account for  198,278t of biomass </li>
<li>  67% of stocks with primary indicators were fished below F<sub>MSY</sub> - (44% of stocks are at unknown fishing mortality status). 11% of landings came from stocks fished below F<sub>MSY</sub>.</li>
<li>  69% of stocks with primary indicators have SSB above MSY B<sub>TRIGGER</sub> (51% of stocks are at unknown biomass status). 79% of landings came from stocks having SSB above MSY B<sub>TRIGGER</sub>. </li>
Great care is needed in the interpretation of these figures.  Only 11% of landings came from stocks fished below F<sub>MSY</sub>. This can be partly explained by the landings of mackerel and blue whiting which are fished above F<sub>MSY</sub>. </p>

<h3> TRENDS  </h3> 
<p> It is important to note that the D3C1 and D3C2 analysis results presented above represent a snapshot.  It is possible to look at progress towards GES targets over time for groups of assessed stocks.  This analysis shows that on average:
<li>  Pelagic stocks have been fished below F<sub>MSY</sub> since the mid-2000s,</li>
<li>  Harvesting of <em>Nephrops</em> stocks has been around F<sub>MSY</sub> and below since 2013.</li>
<li>  Fishing mortality for demersal stocks shows a strongly declining trend since the mid-2000s although it remains above F<sub>MSY</sub>.</li>
<li>  Biomasses of demersal, pelagic and <em>Nephrops</em> stocks are all above MSY B<sub>TRIGGER</sub> since 2010.  The average biomass for demersal stocks shows a strongly increasing trend since the late 2000s.</li>
</p><hr/>
<p> The Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) aims to achieve Good Environmental Status (GES) of the EUs marine waters by 2020 and to protect the resource base upon which marine-related economic and social activities depend.  It is the first EU legislative instrument related to the protection of marine biodiversity, as it contains the explicit regulatory objective that ''biodiversity is maintained by 2020'', as the cornerstone for achieving GES.  The Directive enshrines in a legislative framework the ecosystem approach to the management of human activities having an impact on the marine environment, integrating the concepts of environmental protection and sustainable use.  In order to achieve its goal, the Directive establishes European marine regions and sub-regions on the basis of geographical and environmental criteria. The Directive lists four European marine regions - the Baltic Sea, the North-east Atlantic Ocean, the Mediterranean Sea and the Black Sea.  The sea area around Ireland comprises OSPAR Region III - the Celtic Seas and Irelands MSFD work relates to this area (OSPAR = Oslo Paris Conventions - a mechanism by which the EU and 17 member states co-operate to protect the north east Atlantic ecosystem).  </p>

<p> In order to implement the MSFD, each Member State is required to: 
<li>  Describe what they consider is a clean healthy and productive sea (i.e. GES);</li>
<li>  Monitor and assess the quality of their seas against GES; </li>
<li>  Ensure appropriate action is taken by 2020 to maintain and achieve GES.  </li>
</p>
"
,,"Below is a preliminary assessment of D3 for Ireland. The following points should be noted:
<ol><li> All stocks with an Irish quota are presented. </li>
<li> The GES assessment  follows the advice of ICES by including only those stocks with primary (MSY) indicators, excluding D3C3, and aggregating D3C1 and D3C2 using a conditional method. </li>
<li> Green indicates an acceptable indicator score, red is unacceptable, and grey is unknown. </li></ol>"
Mixed Fisheries,,"<h3> FEAS Advice for 2018 </h3>
<p>FEAS recognises the potential value of mixed fisheries advice as a tool for management of
demersal fisheries in the Celtic Sea. However, the current modelling procedure used to
produce this advice is under development. The methodology and underlying assumptions
need to be investigated further. Therefore mixed fisheries catch option scenarios provided by
ICES, can only be viewed as preliminary and should not be used to set the TACs for cod,
haddock and whiting in the Celtic Sea.</p><hr/>
<h3> Background </h3>
<p>Fisheries in the Celtic Sea are highly mixed, targeting a range of commercial and non-commercial species, with a
variety of different gears. Therefore, in line with the operational nature of the fishery, ICES now produces
mixed-fisheries scenarios for the Celtic Sea. This advice sheet highlights the potential implications of single stock
management on the catches of multiple stocks caught together in mixed-fisheries. The species considered within
this advice are cod (27.7.e-k), haddock (27.7.b-k) and whiting (27.7.b-c & e-k).</p>
<p>Past fishing patterns, catchability of fleets and single species TAC advice are used to produce a quantitative
forecast of over- and under- exploitation of the different stocks given their mixed fishery interactions. Forecasts
are summarised in a range of potential management scenarios.</p>
<p>The mixed-fisheries forecasts produced for 2018 indicate that the most limiting stocks (i.e. the stock where the
first quota is reached for most fleets) in the Celtic Sea gadoid mixed fisheries will be haddock. Under the
scenarios presented for 2018 a significant change to the exploitation pattern for haddock would be required to
avoid overexploitation.</p>
<h3> Summary of Scenarios </h3>
<p>Eight mixed-fisheries forecast scenarios were produced for the Celtic Sea, all of which are defined and detailed
within the ICES advice sheet. Scenarios that result in under- or overutilization of stock are useful in identifying
imbalance between the fishing opportunities of the various stocks. They indicate in which direction fleets may
have to adapt to fully utilize their catch opportunities without collectively exceeding single-stock fishing
opportunities. Here follows a brief summary of the outcomes of these scenarios for 2018 and their associated
landings (Table 1):
<li> The ''minimum'' scenario indicates that haddock is the most limiting stock (representing 64% of effort in
2016). This scenario assumes that the discard ban is strictly implemented for each fleet and fishing stops
when the catch of a fleet reaches its quota share of any of the three stocks.
<li> The ''maximum'' scenario gives very similar results to the ''whiting'' scenario, indicating that whiting is
the least limiting quota. The maximum scenario assumes that there is no limit on discarding and each
fleet continues fishing until they exhaust their quota share of all the stocks.
<li> Only the ''minimum'' and ''haddock'' scenarios meet the objective of all stocks being fished at or below
F<sub>MSY</sub>. The haddock scenario assumes that fishing stops when a fleet reaches its quota share of haddock.
This implies reducing effort levels by 42% compared to those observed in 2016.
<li> The ''range'' scenario may provide a good basis for mixed fisheries management in the future. It utilises
the MSY ranges to minimise the mixed fisheries imbalances in the fishery. That option results in an F
for haddock close to the upper limit of the F<sub>MSY</sub> range. The F for cod slightly below F<sub>MSY</sub> and the F for
whiting well below F<sub>MSY</sub> and close to the lower bound of the F<sub>MSY</sub> range. The resulting biomass
projections in 2019 are above MSY B<sub>trigger</sub> for all three stocks and are therefore can be considered safe
harvesting practices in the short term.</p>
<p>WGMIXFISH produces advice based on catch per mixed-fisheries scenarios in 2018. In total there are 8
scenarios, maximum, minimum, COD, HAD, WHG, status quo effort, value and range. All scenarios are
described in detail in the attached advice sheet. Here FEAS has convert that catch advice given in Table 2 into
approximate landings (tonnes) estimates for each stock and each scenario in the table below. The official ICES
landings for 2016 and the single species advice for 2018 have been included for comparative purposes.</p>"
,,"<h3>Future Direction</h3>
<p>WGMIXFISH will continue work to incorporate other stocks such as plaice, sole and <em>Nephrops</em> stocks into
mixed fisheries forecast in the future. The validity of some of the underlying assumptions, especially the fixed
catchability assumption, needs to be evaluated fully for the Celtic Sea. Management strategy evaluations should
be carried out to assess the performance of mixed fisheries forecasts. Additionally there will be continued
efforts to advance the forecasting capabilities of the model though streamlining of inputs and comparing this
approach with other methods.</p>"
